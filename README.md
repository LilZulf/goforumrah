This is my first project using Next.js. The project is far from complete because I need to make some adjustments using this technology. I've deployed this project at https://goforumrah.kolektifhost.com/ .

Thank you for this opportunity. I've learned a lot about new technology from this test, and I apologize for not finishing this project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
